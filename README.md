     Beyblade World Championship (100 Marks)
    Tyson is all prepared for the Beyblade World Championship. The tournament is team-based and each team can have N members. A player can fight against a single player only. Team    G-Revolution is all excited and pumped up as they have practised a lot.

The tournament is going to start in some time and Kenny moves to the cafeteria to have a snack before the competition.

     The first line of input consists of the number of test cases, T

     The first line of each test case consists of the number of members each team can have, N.

     The second line of each test case consists of N space-separated integers representing the power of beyblades of Team G-Revolution members.

    The third line of each test case consists of N space-separated integers representing the power of beyblades of opponent team members.

    Constraints
    1<= T <=100000
    1<= N <=100000

    0<= Power of Beyblade <= LLONG_MAX

# question 4
    Given any number, we can create a new number by adding the sums of squares of digits of that number. For example, given 203, our new number is 4 + 0 + 9 = 13. If we repeat this process, we get a sequence of numbers:

     Positive output:-
      203 -> 13 -> 10 -> 1 -> 1

     if 1 then - successfully converted to binary digit 1

    Negative output:-
     11 -> 2 -> 4 -> 16 -> ...
     his sequence will never reach 1

     if 1 then - conversion failed
